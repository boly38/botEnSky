#botEnSky

botEnSky is a bot [BlueSky social app](https://bsky.app/)

- status: **Started May 16, work in progress**

It is a NodeJs application that relies on [bsky api](https://docs.bsky.app/).

The goal is to be the worthy successor to [@botentrain1](https://twitter.com/botentrain1) ([src](https://github.com/boly38/botEnTrain)) but for BlueSky.

The search is not the same between the two networks (X, Bsky), so we will have to think about new designs, but the first function considered is plant identification
