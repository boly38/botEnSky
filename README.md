### Plugins
- üß© [Plantnet](src/plugins/Plantnet.js) plugin

*search a post with an embedded image, a not muted author, and without reply using [some questions](src/data/questionsPlantnet.json) and use Pl@ntNet API to try to identify the flower.*
- on **good score** result: post a reply with confident ratio, name, common name, and embed sample image +alt (provided by Pl@ntNet)
- on **bad score** result, or **nothing detected** result: mute author and don't reply. The action to "mute" the author is to avoid to replay the same plantnet identification twice a day (for same result). Muted authors are unMuted by UnMute plugin at the end of the day.

- üß© [askPlantnet](src/plugins/AskPlantnet.js) plugin

*search a post with one of [askPlantnet](src/data/askPlantnet.json) mention, and try to identify the parent post first image using the same previous logic except that bad score or nothing detected will produce a reply to the mention.*


- üß© [unMute](src/plugins/UnMute.js) plugin

*remove bot all muted authors.*

- üß© [Summary](src/plugins/Summary.js) plugin

*get some analytics for last 7 days of bot activity.*

- üß© [BioClip](src/plugins/BioClip.js) plugin

*search a post with an embedded image, a not muted author, and without reply using [some questions](src/data/questionsBioClip.json) and use [GrBird API](https://huggingface.co/spaces/3oly/grBird) to try to classify the bird.*
- on **good score** result: post a reply with confident ratio, species, genus, family, common name, and a link to flickr gallery (provided by [Avibase](https://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/))
- on **bad score** result, or **nothing detected** result: mute author and don't reply. The action to "mute" the author is to avoid to replay the same classification twice a day (for same result). Muted authors are unMuted by UnMute plugin at the end of the day.


- üß© [askBioclip](src/plugins/AskBioclip.js) plugin

*search a post with one of [askBioclip](src/data/askBioclip.json) mention, and try to classify the parent post first image using the same previous logic except that bad score or nothing detected will produce a reply to the mention.*

- üß© [1Day1Bioclip](src/plugins/OneDayOneBioclip.js) plugin

*Every day, the robot searches [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for a collection with one of [this queries](src/data/oneDayOneBioclip.json) for photo of another author and attempts to identify it using Bioclip. The details of the photo and its identification are then posted on Bluesky.*

- üß© [Healthcheck](src/plugins/HealthCheck.js) plugin

*Performs health checks of external services upon manager request. These checks help ensure the system is functioning properly by diagnosing problems.
