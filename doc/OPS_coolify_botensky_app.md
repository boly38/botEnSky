TIP: show debug log to see the very first deployment in details. Coolify is very friendly.

TIP: to test using local WSL2, you could map 127.0.0.1 to a given name ex `coolify.local` and set `General > Domains` with `http://coolify.local/`. In that context, your app is visible from http://coolify.local:5000/
